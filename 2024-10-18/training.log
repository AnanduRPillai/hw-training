Today, I successfully completed the development of my code. I have achieved the following:

Successfully implemented the web crawling and parsing functionality for the project.
Parsed the following fields without any issues:

-first_name
-middle_name
-last_name
-office_name
-title
-description
-languages
-image_url
-address
-city
-state
-country
-zipcode
-office_phone_numbers
-agent_phone_numbers
-email
-website
-social
-profile_url

The data extraction process ran smoothly and accurately, ensuring that all target fields were parsed as expected.
