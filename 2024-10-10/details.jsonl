I'm Dominique, and my path to real estate may be a little different than you'd expect. Growing up, my family always seemed to be renovating our home, and weekends were spent exploring open houses - I was practically born with a paintbrush in one hand and a floor plan in the other!\r\nThis passion for home design led me to the Big Island of Hawaii, where I truly learned the art of building from the ground up. With my family, I constructed a luxury home, getting my hands dirty in every stage of the process. This immersive experience taught me more than just carpentry; it instilled a deep understanding of what makes a house a home.\r\nBut I didn't stop there. My love for art and design took me further, leading me to earn a B.A. in Art History. This broadened my perspective, allowing me to appreciate the rich tapestry of styles and influences that shape our spaces.\r\nToday, I combine my artistic eye, construction knowledge, and global perspective to help you create your own earthly paradise here on the Big Island. Whether you're searching for a cozy cottage or a sprawling estate, I'm here to guide you through the process with expertise and personalized care.\r\nAnd because building community is just as important as building homes, I'm deeply involved in the Big Island life. When I'm not helping clients achieve their real estate dreams, you might find me whipping up delicious treats at Doughmo's Cookies - the perfect way to celebrate new beginnings!\r\nReady to make your Big Island dream a reality?

Attending the University of Hawaii, she obtained a business degree with an emphasis in real estate, as well her real estate license. During college, she worked at a variety of real estate related offices - an appraisal firm, mortgage department of a local bank, and PMI.\r\nAfter a short stint as a commercial loan officer, she transitioned to becoming an appraiser. She went on to attain her certification as a Certified Residential Appraiser, the highest level for a residential appraiser with the expertise to appraise complex properties. She worked in the appraisal industry for over 30 years, but also handled real estate sales. It is her opinion that the two go hand-in-hand, and by doing both, it makes one stronger in each of the respective fields.\r\nChristine grew up in Kaneohe and attended Castle High School. Her love of Kaneohe is the reason she and her family reside there today, close to her parents and mother-in-law. Family and faith are the pillars of her life.\r\nAlways enamored with traveling, Christine was blessed to be able to travel the world through entertaining. Promoting Hawaii with the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, or performing as part of the Maile Aloha Singers, created many wonderful memories. Her love of travel was instilled in her as a young child as her family, before Christine was the age of five, lived in New York, Indonesia and the Philippines before settling in Kaneohe.\r\nPrior to becoming an empty-nester, Christine was very involved in her son\u2019s school while he was growing up.

I was born and raised in Asuncion, Paraguay (South America), but I am of Korean descent and speak Spanish and Korean. When I was 13 years old my family moved to the United States and grew up in Alhambra, California (Los Angeles). My wife and I moved to Oahu, Hawaii in 2018 and fell in love with the diverse culture, kindness of the people, and its natural beauty and plan on making this island our permanent home.\r\nIn high school I played water polo, volleyball, and basketball. However, nowadays I enjoy golfing, surfing, and fishing. Upon graduating from high school, I attended Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, located in Daytona Beach, Florida where I earned my bachelor\u2019s in Aeronautical Science and earned my multi-engine and single-engine commercial pilot\u2019s license.\r\nPost college, wanting to challenge myself both mentally and physically, I decided to join the United States Marine Corps. During my 11 years of honorable service, I had the pleasure of mentoring and leading hundreds of Marines while also having the opportunity to fly tactical aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Additionally, I served as an Air Traffic Control Officer. Throughout my Marine Corps career, my wife and I moved a total of 7 times from coast to coast and to Hawaii (as our last duty station). We have personally purchased properties utilizing the VA loan program in Virginia and Texas, and a condo in Hawaii with conventional financing with the end goal of turning them into investment properties and plan to continue to grow our real estate portfolio. I\u2019m a strong believer of building wealth through real estate.\r\nI joined Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate (BHGRE) Advantage Realty in 2022 because of their core values of putting clients first while harnessing a family-oriented team to better serve clients. The driving force of my decision to pursue real estate was because of my unpleasant first-time home buying experience. In turn, my goal is to ensure every client has the best and smoothest experience throughout the entire process while providing a uniquely tailored service to each one of them. I live by the saying \u201conce you stop learning, you start dying\u201d by Albert Einstein, which drives me to add value as a real estate expert to not only facilitate the current process of buying or selling but to continue to add value through education that my clients will benefit from years down the road.\r\nDuring my time as a Marine Officer, I have truly harnessed the core values of the Unites States Marine Corps (honor, courage, and commitment) and saw, firsthand, the huge impact of living with such values. My diverse background is an asset for my clients when it comes to navigating such a multi-cultural environment, especially in Hawaii. I am looking forward to serving you with the upmost integrity and respect; tenaciously represent you and provide you recommendations (both popular and unpopular opinions) to ensure the best result; and to be fully devoted to you as my client.\r\nMore about Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Advantage Realty:\r\n\r\nAffiliated with an international brand name for worldwide recognition (Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate) BHGRE Advantage Realty has 5 locations across Oahu and Maui Hawaii's best real estate firm the past 11 years by Honolulu Star Advertiser (2010-2020) Best Honolulu real estate firm for 8 years by Honolulu Magazine (2012-2013, 2014-2020) In-house professional photographer, escrow transaction team supporting every step of the process, marketing team with up-to-date trends, targeting a wide audience; and technology to support and reach global clients", "languages": ["English", "Korean", "Spanish"], "image_url": "https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000FrsBQfLpoHjmyjPMKKKZVwlZHdYwo8e/P01600000GDHXTIvKQ0tqi6SIuBjGGZEJicE7ErG.jpg?format=webp&quality=75&width=88", "address": "629 Kailua Road", "city": "Kailua", "state": "HI", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "96734", "office_phone_numbers": ["+18082923427"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["+18082923427"], "email": "daniellk@betterhawaii.com", "website": "https://alohaagentdaniel.com", "social": {}, "profile_url": "https://www.bhgre.com/hi/kailua/agents/daniel-lee-kim/aid-P00200000FrsBQfLpoHjmyjPMKKKZVwlZHdYwo8e"}

{"first_name": "Shari", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Ogata", "office_name": "REALTOR\u00ae", "title": "REALTOR\u00ae", "description": "A local girl, Shari Ogata was born and raised in various neighborhoods on Oahu from the sugar cane fields on Crozier Drive in Waialua to the slopes of lower Manoa. She is a Mililani High School graduate and spent many of her formative years in and around Wahiawa with her paternal grandparents and extended family. Shari currently resides in Kahala with her husband, Eric, an electrical and mechanical engineer and her son, a high school junior at Mid Pacific.\r\nShari earned her Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting and Finance from the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, as well as a Juris Doctorate in Law from the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. After the CPA exam, Shari started her professional career at Deloitte & Touche, an international CPA firm, working in the Tax Divisions in both Seattle, Washington and Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from law school and passing the bar, Shari gained invaluable legal experience working in various private, public, and not-for-profit firms, eventually starting her own law practice helping those less fortunate than herself.\r\nShari\u2019s passion for real estate started early. At a young age, she learned from her parents and grandparents about the power of land ownership in Hawaii. Starting over 25 years ago with her first purchase of a condominium near Punahou School, Shari has slowly and steadily built and managed her own portfolio of residential real estate as a buyer, seller, and lessor. Shari has also been investing, building, renovating, managing, and leasing commercial real estate for the last 23 years as an owner and officer for a large local corporation.\r\nShari\u2019s experience in accounting, law, and real estate prepared Shari for leadership positions as an owner and officer of a large multi-million-dollar company, first as the Chief Financial Officer, then as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Pioneer Contracting Company/dba Pioneer Ace Hardware. At Pioneer, Shari managed a staff of over 140 employees in multiple states in a multi-faceted business with three separate divisions: a construction company operating primarily on military bases in Oahu, Hawaii; multi-chain, multi-state Ace Hardware stores; and a commercial property division that owns, develops, and leases multiple properties and shopping centers on Oahu and on the mainland. Under her guidance, Pioneer thrived with double digit increases in both top line sales and bottom-line profits, even through the Great Recession. Shari recently sold her ownership interest in the company, which has allowed her to concentrate all her efforts on her passion for real estate.\r\nWith her wealth of real estate, accounting, legal, and business experience, Shari is uniquely prepared and qualified to handle all aspects of her clients\u2019 real estate transactions. Her accounting background provides the financial discipline and attention to detail necessary to scrutinize your transaction from every angle, while her legal background is invaluable in risk analysis and negotiation of the best possible price and terms. Her experience as a business owner/operator provides her with a big picture perspective to determine whether a real estate transaction makes sense for a client\u2019s given situation.\r\nReal estate has always been Shari\u2019s passion. It is her goal to provide her clients of all experience levels, from first-time buyers to experienced real estate investors, with the highest level of professional excellence. Shari attributes her success to her deep faith, her supportive husband and son, her dedication to excellent customer service, and her commitment to and passion for helping others in whatever capacity she can.", "languages": ["English"], "image_url": "https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000FDdrkqRBBRlOYaXlnGBeefX2FUh0BfB/P01600000FR3TTKTg6PJrSCOutJpRaid31P4P3a3.jpg?format=webp&quality=75&width=88", "address": "4211 Waialae Avenue", "city": "Honolulu", "state": "HI", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "96816", "office_phone_numbers": ["+18087817777"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["+18087817777"], "email": "shario@betterhawaii.com", "website": "", "social": {}, "profile_url": "https://www.bhgre.com/hi/honolulu/agents/shari-ogata/aid-P00200000FDdrkqRBBRlOYaXlnGBeefX2FUh0BfB"}

I was born in Thailand and grew up in Hawaii. The joy of travel is one of my favorite things to do as well as exploring new eateries all over the island. I enjoy hiking, having jog/walks with Bailey, my golden retriever furry baby. I graduated from U.H. Manoa with a B.A in Speech. I have been a Financial Planner for over 20+ years and have had the opportunity to work with and create valued friendships with individuals, families and local small businesses as well. Purchasing real estate is a huge financial decision that I've had the pleasure to provide guidance for my clients, along with balancing their overall Financial portfolio needs. Having bought, renovated and sold my own properties, lead me to pursue my passion and explore my creative side in designing and interior decorating both big and small spaces. I feel very fortunate to be part of the Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Advantage Realty. We, as a team, have got your back to assist you with finding your dream home.\r\nI'd like to share with you one of my favorite analogies, titled \"Marathon Baby.\" One of my bucket list items was to run the Honolulu Marathon. In 2015, I ran the Honolulu Marathon and was fortunate enough to complete it in good health. My analogy is that: you trained for 9 months running longer and longer distances over time, such that one tends to be pregnant for 9 months. While running the marathon, as I like to describe it, it's more like being in labor, however long it takes for you to complete the marathon. Once you have crossed that finish line, you have earned your Finisher's medal (you have your precious marathon baby). How does this relate to Real Estate? We are with you from start to finish, in finding your dream home or selling it.

He knows firsthand the stress and emotional tolls, but ultimately, the joy and excitement that purchasing or selling a home can bring, and prides himself in providing only first-class service to his clients. This includes collaborating with best-in-class service partners and working with the most-trusted vendors. His core belief is that communication is key and he is trusted for being upfron t when it comes to weighing the pros and cons, guiding clients with expertise through tough decisions and representing their best interests by walking them through the real estate and escrow process every step of the way.\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege of wearing a few different hats throughout my career, from President to general counsel for some of Hawaii\u2019s leading real estate service firms. I\u2019ve tackled and resolved every imaginable situation that could make, delay or break a real estate transaction. Now, I\u2019m in a position that finally allows me to bring all of my expertise to the table to genuinely help people\u2014one at a time\u2014to have freedom and opportunity in their lives through real estate. And nothing has made me happier.\u201d\r\n\r\nWill admits that empowering others is a personal passion that developed when he was just 6-years old. Born in Tokyo, Japan, he distinctly remembers the financial sacrifices and struggles his parents endured when they gave up everything they had to move their family to Gardena, California.\r\n\u201cMy parents never owned a home. They hopped from one job to another to support us. They sacrificed their comfortable life in Japan so that my siblings and I could have the opportunities they never did\u2014to pursue our passions.\u201d\r\nWill majored in English at UCLA before attending William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii, where he received his Juris Doctor degree. It was his passion for law early in his career that landed him at Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel , one of Hawaii\u2019s largest and premier law firms, where he spent nearly 5 years as a litigation attorney. His segue into real estate came when he took on the role of Vice President and General Counsel for Fidelity National Title & Escrow of Hawaii , a Fortune 500 company and the nation\u2019s largest real estate service/title insurance company. It was there that his natural instinct for business and leadership also thrived. So much so that in 2016, Will was asked to join First Hawaii Title Corporation , a longstanding and highly-respected Hawaii escrow and title company, as President.\r\n\u201cI was tasked to create sustainable growth and open new markets for the company. Aside from the obvious business measures, this also meant establishing a new, authentically happy growth culture. My vision was to become known as the best customer-service company. And that starts with the employees. I\u2019m proud to have left that legacy.\u201d\r\nWith his inherent passion for empowering others, combined with his business acumen and legal prowess, Will has often been described as \u201cthe ultimate real estate trifecta.\u201d He is a fierce, but fair negotiator , a creative problem solver , and is always thinking two-steps ahead to ensure a smooth transaction and give peace of mind to his clients.\r\nWill\u2019s primary focus is on residential homes and investment properties on the island of Oahu. He also specializes in:\r\n\u2022 1031 exchanges\r\n\u2022 Trust property and probate/estate transactions\r\n\u2022 Divorce Sales\r\n\u2022 REO Transactions, Short Sales, Foreclosure Auctions\r\nTeaming with Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate Advantage Realty, whose clients-always-first mindset, innovative marketing strategies and immense network is a perfect match for his commitment to superior customer service.

{"first_name": "Marilyn", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Kidder", "office_name": "Real Estate Broker", "title": "Real Estate Broker", "description": "I've lived in the New London/Lake Sunapee area since 1972, and, along with my husband, Bill (who died in 1998 of cancer), raised our two sons, plus several generations of sheep, pigs, and Labrador retrievers on our 1779 farm just outside of town.\r\nOutside of running my business and raising a family over the last 45 years, I have also volunteered on countless local and statewide boards including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests; the Ausbon Sargent Land Preservation Trust Board (Chairman for 2 years) and Lands Committee; the Pleasant Lake Protective Association, Lake Sunapee Protective Association (Board, 2004; and on its Land Protection Committee); the New London Historical Society, the Lake Sunapee Area Chamber of Commerce, The WFK Ice House Foundation Board (The Ice House Museum) as Secretary/Treasurer; the Citizens' Advisory Council, Town of New London), the President's Advisory Council of Colby-Sawyer College, and the Colby-Sawyer College Community Forum; and, most recently, the Board of Trustees of Kearsarge Council on Aging.\r\nFor fun, the thing I love most is to spend time with my grown-up family (both sons live in town)-and especially my three grandchildren, but I also enjoy trying to keep up with my substantial perennial gardens, dubbing around the \"farm\", reading, attending local events, getting outside in the winter and summer, but especially spending time during the summer boating and beaching with family and friends at our special spot on Pleasant Lake.\r\nBut I also have always had fun in my chosen career. I began my commitment to real estate in 1983, with Country Houses, a well-respected local firm, which had been purchased from the original owner by a close friend. In 1987, I moved on to start my own company with a partner and one secretary. Six years later, we affiliated with Coldwell Banker to bring the benefit of an international brand with an excellent reputation to our clients. For about 20 years, that proved to have been a good decision. During most of that time, I was the sole owner of the company (Milestone Real Estate, Inc.), and by 2016 had built it to its current number of 7 energetic sales associates/brokers and 3/4 support personnel.\r\n2016 brought some very exciting changes. That fall , \u201cThe Best Team in Town\u201d became even better\u2026through the acquisition of the marketing rights to a Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate franchise for New London and the Greater Lake Sunapee Region through a strategic partnership with Better Homes and Gardens/The Masiello Group. With a 33+ office network, The Masiello Group is the largest real estate company north of Boston.\r\n\r\nFor more than 90 years Better Homes and Gardens\u00ae has been the most trusted source of inspiration for all things related to the home. BHG Real Estate carries the brand across all aspects of our daily lives and creates instant positive recognition. We feel that BHGRE\u2019s reputation and national exposure and The Masiello Group\u2019s strength in northern New England create a perfect combination with our local experience and expertise.

He has persevered to top these achievements by leading the Ellis-Nabors Team onto receiving many top-ranking awards! This stellar performance earned them well-deserved spots on both of the Houston Business Journal's lists, Gross Dollar Volume and Number of Closed Transactions, for 2011, 2012 2013, & 2014 dedicated to Houston's \"Top 25 Residential Real Estate Teams\" - a crowning achievement!

He is always enhancing and developing his skills with continuing education. He is Relocation Certified and a member of the Inventory Home Market Specialist Team. During part of his real estate career, Clint worked as a sales counselor for a top new home builder in Houston and believes that experience gives him an edge in new-construction home buying and selling. \"I am very familiar with the building process,\" he says. Clint also distinguishes himself with his comprehensive marketing strategies and negotiating skills. He is levelheaded and addresses each transaction with patience and persistence. A problem solver and educator, he uses his skills to make the transaction as smooth as possible, while keeping his clients well informed and their best interests in mind. Clint is also a person of strong Christian faith; putting God as the head of his life, family and business keeps him grounded and focused. Th e rewards of Clint's faith, experience and knowledge are reflected in his many satisfied clients. Said one: \"We were very happy with Clint and his insight and caring to meet our needs. If we need to move again, we will definitely choose Clint and Heritage Texas Properties.\" It is through Clint's vision that the Ellis-Nabors Team has grown to the level of success that they are today. He oversees, trains, and motivates the team's 4 licensed agents, and serves as the team leader. Clint and his Realtor wife, Amy, also a Baylor graduate, teamed up with her parents, Mark and Catherine Ellis, both of whom have long and successful real estate careers, to form the Ellis-Nabors Team. All who know them agree they are a dynamic force with a multitude of talents that better serve all their clients' needs. They mutually agree, \"Superior service is our focus!\" and they work hard to exceed the expectations of every client. These highly motivated agents say, \"We love working with people and enjoy helping them purchase their dream home.\" Whether working with buyers or sellers, the team puts their clients' needs fi rst, and they are diligent about maintaining good follow-up. Friendly and funny, they are a pleasure to work with, but they maintain the highest standards at all times. The team is ably assisted by team manager and licensed associate, Karen Zientek, team listing coordinator and team accountant, Clint's mother, Diann Nabors, in addition to licensed agents, Ainsley Curry and Amy's younger sister, Katie Ellis. The Ellis-Nabors Team is principally focused on Cypress and Northwest Houston but has roots in the community throughout Greater Houston. A native Houstonian, Clint knows his city and has an extensive market area including Fairfi eld, Copperfi eld, Cinco Ranch, Coles Crossing, BlackHorse Ranch, Bridgeland, and Lakes of Fairhaven.

My goal is to make the whole process as stress free as possible while keeping my clients informed every step of the way.\r\nSince my father was in the Army and my husband was in the Marines, their experiences have helped serve me as I have interacted with many military families. This comes in handy since they are not always able to view homes in person.\r\nAfter marrying my husband, starting a family and being blessed with two beautiful children, my personal relocation experience began. My husband\u2019s success in his field would result in five (5) corporate relocations in the last 20 years. Having lived through every aspect of those major life changing events, I know how stressful this can be on a family. Not only did we have to keep our current house \u201cshow ready\u201d but we had to find the perfect house which had to be in close proximity to an ice rink since both of our children loved to skate (resulting in a competitive figure skater as well as an elite hockey player). These experiences made me truly appreciate having a great Realtor who understood that it was not always just about buying or selling the house!\r\nOn our fourth relocation, which sent us to Houston, Texas, I made the decision to become a Realtor with the hope to take my experiences and knowledge and use it to help others. Our last relocation was to the Northern Virginia area and am very pleased to call this our final home.\r\nMy experience includes formal appraisal training and I strive to take continuing education classes whenever possible so I\u2019m up to date on any new policies or trends in the market. I have extensive personal knowledge in the building process as well since we have designed and built homes ranging from $125K to $1M+ across multiple states. I have been fortunate to be ranked as a Residential Top Producer in NOVA multiple years and will work hard to continue to do so.\r\n\r\nBeing an empty nester now, I enjoy exploring everything this region has to offer. This includes, but is not limited to, hiking, working out, visiting all the great wineries and of course eating at all the fantastic restaurants in the area.

After attending the University of Alabama, Huntsville Campus, I joined The Residence Inn Hotel Group in Huntsville. A couple of years into my hospitality career, I was offered a transfer to Altamonte Springs, Florida, which I quickly accepted. Shortly after my relocation to North Orlando/Altamonte Springs, Marriott Hotels purchased the Residence Inn brand. I remained with Marriott International for my entire career. Upon completing a successful career with Marriott International in the hotel division and the vacation ownership division, I decided to use my skill set and wealth of customer service experience to launch my Real Estate Career. My time in both divisions afforded me experience in areas associated with real estate. On the hotel side, I dealt with many families either relocating to or from the areas of the hotel markets that I worked in. Whether selling and moving to another area or buying and moving into a new city, there was always a lot of emotion for them. In the vacation ownership division, our guests were making purchasing decisions to become owners. So often the owners were experiencing excitement coupled with a sense of fear. These years of guest and owner opportunities prepared me for the next phase of my life-a career in Real Estate! Having discovered New Smyrna Beach in 2000, I knew I wanted to call this quaint Florida city home one day. The community has maintained the wholesome beach feeling that I cherish! In November 2016, I moved to New Smyrna Beach with my partner in crime, Brady (a Welsh Corgi) and embarked on my Realtor journey!

After attending the University of Alabama, Huntsville Campus, I joined The Residence Inn Hotel Group in Huntsville. A couple of years into my hospitality career, I was offered a transfer to Altamonte Springs, Florida, which I quickly accepted. Shortly after my relocation to North Orlando/Altamonte Springs, Marriott Hotels purchased the Residence Inn brand. I remained with Marriott International for my entire career. Upon completing a successful career with Marriott International in the hotel division and the vacation ownership division, I decided to use my skill set and wealth of customer service experience to launch my Real Estate Career. My time in both divisions afforded me experience in areas associated with real estate. On the hotel side, I dealt with many families either relocating to or from the areas of the hotel markets that I worked in. Whether selling and moving to another area or buying and moving into a new city, there was always a lot of emotion for them. In the vacation ownership division, our guests were making purchasing decisions to become owners. So often the owners were experiencing excitement coupled with a sense of fear. These years of guest and owner opportunities prepared me for the next phase of my life-a career in Real Estate! Having discovered New Smyrna Beach in 2000, I knew I wanted to call this quaint Florida city home one day. The community has maintained the wholesome beach feeling that I cherish! In November 2016, I moved to New Smyrna Beach with my partner in crime, Brady (a Welsh Corgi) and embarked on my Realtor journey!

I have since moved on from the food and beverage industry and have been working at Bucky\u2019s and Yavapai Casinos as a Shift Manager since 2013. Whatever profession I am in, it seems to revolve around people and taking care of their wants and needs. Therefore, it was a natural progression to join Theresa in real estate.

Theresa has a wealth of experience and time as a seasoned agent, and together we are able to help clients achieve their goals.\r\nWhen listing your home, I not only bring my own skills to the table, but I also have and a team of highly trained marketing personnel that lead and guide me in marketing your home with state-of-the-art tools.

These are as follows: Experience, Exceptional Marketing, & an Engaging personality. I'd like to review these three qualities with you now. Firstly, Experience: For the last 6 years, I have sold at least 150 homes a year in Hampton Roads. Typically more than this! My team was recently ranked 2nd in the world for Better Homes and Gardens. I'm mentioning these awards here in my bio because performance matters when working with a home sale. This is likely the largest sale of your life and you owe it to yourself to find someone that has the marketing prowess to set your home apart and the experience to make the process more enjoyable. Secondly, Exceptional Marketing: We currently use the most advanced and comprehensive real estate marketing company in the country to market our listings. I could go on and on here but you will be blown away with how we put your home in front of thousands of home buyers daily. I would be excited to review this in person. Lastly, Engaging Personality: My wife of 15 years still laughs at my jokes but more importantly I consider you to be my supervisor.

{"first_name": "Jon", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Murray", "office_name": "Centerville, OH", "title": "Centerville, OH", "description": "As a child, Jon was raised on a small farm in Lewisburg where he learned the value of hard work. Jon learned discipline and how to overcome adversity while he was a standout athlete at Tri-County North High School. While Jon was in high school, he worked in residential construction, building and remodeling houses. Helping to advise buyers and sellers on updating and remodeling projects turned out to be the perfect catalyst for Jon's real estate career. After high school, Jon attended Ohio Northern University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Exercise Physiology. While at Ohio Northern, Jon was on the varsity football team as well the indoor and outdoor track teams. In addition, while at Ohio Northern, Jon was one of the top ranked power lifters in the world. After college, he worked in his field for a year and received several high paying job offers in New York. Jon loves the Miami Valley and just could not imagine moving away. So to have a stable income, Jon went back to building and remodeling houses where he became the foreman for AK Construction. While working in the construction field, Jon enjoyed the daily interaction with people who were considering building houses. When his boss started buying properties and fixing them up and selling them or renting them, Jon became motivated to purchase his own fixer upper house to renovate on the side. He enjoyed this type of work tremendously. Jon realized that if he got his real estate license, he could have better access to find the deals for himself and his boss. Jon went back to school and obtained his real estate license with the intention of just representing himself and family and friends. While renovating a house one weekend, Jon seriously injured his back on the job site. Since Jon could not physically work on houses anymore, he was forced to make the decision to work as a Realtor full time. Within a short period of time, Jon was so busy helping others buy and sell real estate that he never went back to work building houses. Within a year or so, Jon was representing so many buyers, sellers, and other investors that he stopped working on houses all together. Getting into real estate was a great decision for Jon because he has been one of the top agents in the area for several years and he and his partner were the top two agents in the entire company in 2009. Jon's honesty and unparalleled work ethic have made his past clients loyal supporters who tell everyone that they have to use Jon because he is the best Realtor they've ever worked with. Jon now lives in Kettering with his wife Jena who was his high school sweet heart. Living with them is their wild daughter Paige along with their first two furry kids, Max & Lily.

Scott was raised in Atlanta but spent a lot of time with his grandparents in Pinehurst, learning not only the finer points of golf, but life lessons in general. When he was four years old, he recalls his father and grandfather presenting him with \"an old sawed-off club,\" and Scott quickly fell in love with the game.

I grew up playing basketball and baseball, all the way through High School. After finishing High School in 2004, I moved to Natchitoches, LA, which is the hometown of my wife, Casie. I spent over 15 years there and consider it my second home. We said our vows on May 1, 2006, and have reached so many life milestones during the last 18 years. We purchased our first home in 2006, and our first son, Ashton, was born in 2008. Our second son, River, came in 2015. We moved back to Evangeline Parish in 2020 and have spent that time establishing our businesses in a new area. Casie is a professional Photographer and started her business in 2012. She specializes in personal sales of her work. My work background covers a broad area of construction and electrical work. From residential homes to industrial workplaces, to management in Third Party services for on land Oil and Gas sites, I continue to use the knowledge and experience that I have gained to assist clients in my Real Estate career. I attended Northwestern State University in Natchitoches for a short time. During my enrollment there, I started out in the Nursing program to pursue an associate degree in nursing for an RN. After deciding to pursue my Real Estate License in 2017, I decided to change my major to Business, and studied in Multiple Business courses and Computer Science courses. I elected to work full time in Real Estate before attaining a degree, and I truly do not regret it. I love working with my clients and have gained the trust and appreciation of so many wonderful people since 2018.", "languages": [], "image_url": "https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000GdvTfIOBLHeKAdo2qvj1HlaQLGgkGX1/P01600000Ge2IHnGr5JKOlAx4quE6bqaLA87UNvj.jpg?format=webp&quality=75&width=88", "address": "1234 Texas Avenue", "city": "Alexandria", "state": "LA", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "71301", "office_phone_numbers": ["+13183326569"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["+13183326569"], "email": "michael@rhodesrealtyla.com", "website": "", "social": {}, "profile_url": "https://www.bhgre.com/la/alexandria/agents/michael-deville/aid-P00200000GdvTfIOBLHeKAdo2qvj1HlaQLGgkGX1"}

{"first_name": "David", "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Orgaz", "office_name": "Keene, NH", "title": "Keene, NH", "description": "When I made the transition into real estate in 2005 after a successful 30+ year foodservice career, times were trying in the industry. The Great Recession began two years into my career just when I should have been ramping up by making contacts and establishing a customer base in a solid region. It turned out to be a time to hone my skill in communication, ( as social media as we know it today was exploding on the scene ), and develop a thorough understanding of all aspects of the business. It was a time when many new and seasoned agents were dropping out of real estate. By staying the course, I maintained Top Producer status in my office of 13 agents of The Masiello Group from 2008 to the present. The Great Recession also gave me the opportunity to get more involved in my community and local and state boards. I joined the Contoocook Valley Board of Realtors, served actively on several committees and served as its President 3 times, in 2009, 2010, and 2016. I still remain active on that board. I also became a 6 year member of the Board of Directors for Monadnock Family Services in Keene and served 6 years on the Board of The Greater Peterborough Chamber of Commerce. My volunteering services earned me the Realtor Honor Society recognition from The Contoocook Valley Board for 14 years. I was also recognized as the Contoocook Valley Board Realtor of the Year in 2009 and 2016. Since 2017, I am the National Association of Realtors Federal Political Coordinator to Congresswoman Annie Kuster. This non partisan position has me in direct contact with our representative in Congress , relaying to her the real estate needs and concerns of the buying and selling public and for Realtors in the 2nd Congressional District in NH. Every member of Congress and every Senator nationwide has a Realtor assigned to them, and I am proud to fill this position in NH. Most importantly, my 15 years as a full time Realtor has taught me about how being proactive and communicating to the hilt makes for smooth and successful transactions, helping prole find their new of first home and helping others sell during a life transition or other reason. And equally important, my personal move to Keene is a positive change for me. Since Keene is my hometown, I hope to renew old contacts and create lots of new ones. This is a great region of New Hampshire and I know it well, and look forward to growing my business here and remain successful by creating a memorable home buying or selling experience with you.", "languages": ["English"], "image_url": "https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000FDdtQ9ErsRdw1VjvTAIEJK0VX64PBmu/P01600000FR3Jcdq6Xmysd6t8FrIjy6lfkd058iQ.jpg?format=webp&quality=75&width=88", "address": "69A Island Street", "city": "Keene", "state": "NH", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "03431", "office_phone_numbers": ["+16033525433"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["+16033525433"], "email": "dorgaz@masiello.com", "website": "https://davidorgaz.masiello.com", "social": {}, "profile_url": "https://www.bhgre.com/nh/keene/agents/david-orgaz/aid-P00200000FDdtQ9ErsRdw1VjvTAIEJK0VX64PBmu"}

I'm also a former educator, and have been since 1993. So if you're looking for an agent who is equally competent, compassionate, and patient, look no further. You've found her. My love for real estate began when I was a little girl. I recall flipping through interior design catalogs, looking for ideas and imagining what I could do in my own home someday. In 1996, I married my husband Shane a custom home builder and that passion and enthusiasm for detail, design and construction grew, further advancing my passion and love for real estate. Today, I'm a licensed real estate agent in New Hampshire. I guess it was always meant to be. I took a roundabout path into the real estate industry. I've been a certified educator in the state of NH since 1993. I'm no longer teaching, but I value the experience gained in the classroom and in working with families, colleagues and administrators. Learning to be flexible, anticipate needs, negotiate alternatives and set high standards are lessons that serve me well in the real estate profession as well. What does this have to do with real estate, you might be wondering? For one thing, it says something about me, as a person. I pursued education because I am a caring, compassionate person that wanted to make a difference. These traits also serve me well as a real estate agent. Some agents view real estate from an asset perspective, focusing solely on bricks and mortar, dollars and cents. I have a different view. I see real estate as a people business, first and foremost. It's more than just dollars and cents. It's about people, and their hopes and dreams. When I'm not helping my clients, I enjoy reading, skiing, exploring and taking in an amazing sunset over a beautiful lake. My true passions in life are my husband Shane, and our children Hailee, Kaylyn and Benjamin. I also currently serve on the Board of Directors for the Suncook Lakes Association. If you have any questions about my real estate services, or what I can do to help you, please don't hesitate to ask.

I volunteered for 15 years, attending community meetings, leading school activities and chaired PTA Membership for many of those years. 2020 has been an unusual year but it has given me the opportunity to become a licensed Real Estate Agent, something I have been talking about for many years. I am a people person and yes, a clich\u00e9, but nevertheless true. In only my second week as a Real Estate Agent, I got my first offer. I was very honored to learn that my new client, of only one week, was speaking highly of me to a colleague. I will ensure that all my clients are happy with the services I provide and the meaningful relationship I will build. If you're looking for an energetic Real Estate Agent who is easy to work with and diligent to find your next home or the perfect buyer for the home you have loved, then give me a call!", "languages": ["English"], "image_url": "https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000FTmKJleSBSS3RqVi1QL8A9iYTZznEsW/P01600000FV5EuaL4NeJJurFWtvrAWJGnKHGwI15.jpg?format=webp&quality=75&width=88", "address": "588 Monroe Turnpike", "city": "Monroe", "state": "CT", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "06468", "office_phone_numbers": ["+19175836564"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["+19175836564"], "email": "dschmidt.homes@gmail.com", "website": "", "social": {}, "profile_url": "https://www.bhgre.com/ct/monroe/agents/debra-schmidt/aid-P00200000FTmKJleSBSS3RqVi1QL8A9iYTZznEsW"}

I use my real estate background plus 20 years of marketing, branding, business and sales experience to help buyers, sellers and investors realize their dreams and property\u2019s potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommitted to Exceeding Expectations\r\nWith a passion for the coastal living market and beyond, I\u2019m committed to helping those along Connecticut\u2019s seaboard fulfill all their real estate sales, purchase and rental needs. As a real estate agent with a Master\u2019s in Marketing and Management and decades of promotional experience under my belt, I provide my clients with the customized strategies and edge they need to be successful in today\u2019s competitive market. My goal is simple: to make your home buying or home selling dreams come true by effectively guiding you through the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocally Known, Globally Connected.\r\nBorn in Montreuil, France of Portuguese parents, I emigrated to the United States in 1987 with my family and settled in Connecticut, where I have remained rooted ever since. I was raised in Fairfield County and have lived in Milford for the last 12 years, which has afforded me extensive knowledge of what it\u2019s like to live in the area. As a result of my diverse background, I\u2019m trilingual in Portuguese, French and English, as well as proficient in Spanish. Being fluent in so many languages has enabled me to build strong social and business connections locally and around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the daughter of a builder, I\u2019ve been involved in real estate since a young age. But before I embarked on a career in the field, I spent two decades leading the branding and marketing initiatives of a global 95-year-old beauty industry company. As a high-level executive, I oversaw the development and implementation of new product lines, as well as managed the company\u2019s online presence, public relations, influencer/artist relations, trade shows, special events, education and creative development. Leveraging the power of digital and social media, I developed strategies that successfully rebranded the company and garnered recognition for our initiatives. I use this vast digital experience to creatively leverage social media and other marketing channels to my client\u2019s advantage when selling their homes and negotiating offers.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong Ties to the Community\r\nI feel truly blessed to live in the Milford area. With my husband, I\u2019m the proud owner of one of Milford\u2019s landmark destinations: The Greek Spot Cafe. Our cafe is situated in the heart of the residential neighborhood in which we live with access to Connecticut\u2019s beautiful and exclusive destinations of Silver Sands Beach and Charles Island. And being the mother of three young sons, who are very involved in local sports and other activities, my feelings about this community have only grown stronger. I\u2019m so grateful for how the cafe and our family activities have enabled us to build strong connections with both locals and vacationers alike with whom I share my passion for living near the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a true beach lover, when I\u2019m not helping my clients or watching my sons do their thing, you\u2019re likely to find me paddle boarding along the Connecticut shoreline or relaxing in the sand with family and friends \u2013 I love to cook and entertain \u2013 or perhaps engrossed in my other loves of interior design and international travel!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about how we can work together, please call or text me at 203-520-2305.", "languages": ["English", "French", "Portuguese", "Spanish"], "image_url": "https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000FrtBSZVZb167IaI3hbbE1f4XGpeuk4u/P01600000GGnsO7ReX6ewmha9Tm8CoBL6LsdD4C2.jpg?format=webp&quality=75&width=88", "address": "588 Monroe Turnpike", "city": "Monroe", "state": "CT", "country": "United States", "zipcode": "06468", "office_phone_numbers": ["+12035202305"], "agent_phone_numbers": ["+12035202305"], "email": "skcoastallivinghomes@gmail.com", "website": "", "social": {}, "profile_url": "https://www.bhgre.com/ct/monroe/agents/stephanie-koutikas/aid-P00200000FrtBSZVZb167IaI3hbbE1f4XGpeuk4u"}

I have been lucky enough to call my second home Long Beach Island. Growing up on LBI, I learned a new definition to quiet winters and busy summers. I bought my first home at 24 years old, and have continued to visit Open Houses since then always itching to move, renovate and redecorate a \"new to me home.\" My current home was built in 1942, so I just cannot seem to let the old school charm go, although a dream of mine has to always design and build my own home. I spend my summers in LBI (and any other time I get the chance to be there). During Covid, I went through The Ocean County Fire Academy and have been a top 10 call runner for Beach Haven Volunteer Fire Company. I enjoy spending time at the beach but also in the city. I'm all ears when it comes to finding your perfect home, whether buying or renting. Let me help you find your dream home!

I started out as a French Trained Pastry Chef! After the Culinary Industry took a huge hit in NYC, where I grew up and worked during 9/11, the need for adequate mental health care for First Responders inspired me to get a B.A. in Psychology. I think all Agents get a crash course in Psychology whether they intended to or not. In my experience with clients, people in the real estate market are primarily concerned with feeling secure throughout the process. I work tirelessly to provide that security. My 'niche', if you want to call it that, is effectively managing the range of emotions that are evoked during a real estate transaction. There is laughter and sometimes there are tears.

I am a licensed Florida Realtor who services in Pensacola, Pace, Milton, and surrounding areas. I am very grateful to say that I am a top producer within my company and within the region. Here is a little bit about me: I have been married to my partner in crime since 1993. We have three grown sons and a wonderful daughter in law. I graduated from California Baptist University in 1993 and taught P.E. in California before moving across country to Pensacola where we bought our first home. As a former middle school math teacher, the transition to real estate seemed like a big leap. In 2008, my husband and I lost our home, having to rebuild. This made me realize that I could help others navigate this realm of home-buying. After experiencing the homebuying process myself, I realized that what was missing in the field was a sense of family. I do genuinely love people, and vow to treat my clients as family.

Im Kellie Thompson, real estate agent and a long time resident of Bentonville, Arkansas. I moved to Northwest Arkansas when I was in the 5th grade, back when I complained about there being only one restaurant in town and having to drive to Tulsa or Joplin for shopping. Ive enjoyed watching my hometown blossom into a beautiful and vibrant city that attracts people from all over the country. I've been married for 17 years to my high school sweetheart. We have three children (ages 14, 12, and 6) that keep us very busy with all of their sports and passions. We are lucky enough to have our entire family still residing in Bentonville and enjoy spending time with them regularly. Before I decided to get into real estate, I was a nurse at Mercy Hospital, Women's and Childrens, for 10 years. After retiring from nursing, I began working with my husband at our home construction company. My experience in construction and nursing prepared me well for a career in real estate. My clients appreciate my compassionate nature, extensive knowledge of the area and experience in home-planning and design. During my free time, I enjoy attending Cross Church Pinnacle Hills, reading, spending time on Beaver Lake and bike riding the local trails with family and friends.","languages":["English"],"image_url":"https://images.cloud.realogyprod.com/agents/BHG/P00200000G3J0e0vLdTTnIeIiJnZkGzg7VVOx0GJ/P01600000G3J02CconQWhDSRXPc1zpBGHhLS51ZL.jpg","address":"523 Southeast 6th Street","city":"Bentonville","state":"AR","country":"United States","zipcode":"72712","office_phone_numbers":["+14793812019"],"agent_phone_numbers":["+14793812019"],"email":"kellie@bhgre-journey.com","website":"","social":{},"profile_url":"https://www.bhgre.com/ar/bentonville/agents/kellie-thompson/aid-P00200000G3J0e0vLdTTnIeIiJnZkGzg7VVOx0GJ"}
