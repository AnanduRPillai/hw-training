I have studied PostgreSQL (psql) and MySQL today, covering the following topics:

    -Overview of PostgreSQL and MySQL.
    -Data models used by each (object-relational for PostgreSQL, relational for MySQL).
    -SQL compliance levels.
    -Performance characteristics, focusing on read/write operations.
    -Data types and extensions supported.
    -ACID compliance and transaction handling.
    -Indexing methods and query optimization.
    -Replication and clustering capabilities.
    -Security features in both databases.
    -Community support and licensing.
    -Common use cases for each database.
