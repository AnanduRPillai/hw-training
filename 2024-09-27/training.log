Crawling of Agent URLs:

2- All agent profile URLs from the designated website have been successfully crawled.
-These URLs have been efficiently stored in the database, ensuring a structured and organized record for further use in the next phases of development.

3- Development and Parsing Progress:
-The development and implementation of the parsing logic are currently in progress.
-This phase will focus on extracting the detailed agent information (such as contact details, profile descriptions, etc.) from the previously crawled URLs.
-I am working on refining the parsing code to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the data extraction process.
