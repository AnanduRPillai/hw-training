i havce completed basic python program that tracks the employees do throughout the workday.

Key Requirements

    - Daily Logs: Every day, the system should create a separate file (in JSON format) for each employee. This file will keep track of all the tasks that the employee worked on that day.
    - Login and Logout: The employee should log in to the system when they start their day and log out when they finish. The system will record these times.
    - Task Management:
        Start Task: When an employee begins a task, they should log the start time and provide a brief description of the task.
        End Task: When they finish the task, they log the end time and indicate whether the task was completed successfully.
    - File Structure: At the end of the day, the system should generate a JSON file containing:
        The employeeâ€™s name and ID.
        The time they logged in and logged out.
        A list of all the tasks they worked on, including start and end times and whether each task was successful.

Also, I have completed all the given browser analysis methods.
