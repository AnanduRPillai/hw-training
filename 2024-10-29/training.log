1- Today, I completed the code development that I started yesterday, enhancing the overall functionality of the program.

2- I successfully resolved the 403 error that was preventing access to some URLs, which enabled me to parse data from those links.

3- My next task is to develop a code that counts specific fields in the parsed data and updates the results to a spreadsheet.

4- This task is currently in progress.
