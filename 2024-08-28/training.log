    -Exporting, importing, dumping, and restoring data
    -Using GUI tools such as Compass
    -Sharding, clustering, and nodes
    -Indexing
    -Understanding Object IDs and generating timestamps from them
    -Following MongoDB guidelines
    -Indexing with unique keys
    -Sharding of collections and databases
    -Naming standards for collections and databases
    -Data backup procedures
