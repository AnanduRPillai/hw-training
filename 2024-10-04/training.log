1- JSON Validation Completed:
   Today, I completed the validation of all four JSON files successfully. Each file was checked for formatting and data integrity, and I can confirm that there are no issues.

2- Ongoing CURL Response Checks:
   I am currently in progress with the response checks using CURL. I will keep monitoring this and provide updates as necessary.
