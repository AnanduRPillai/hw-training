1- New Fields Added:
    I have enhanced my parser code by introducing additional fields to capture more detailed product information. These fields are:

       -unique_id
       -product_name
       -brand
       -product_hierarchy_level1 through product_hierarchy_level7 (to represent the product category structure)
       -regular_price
       -selling_price
       -price_per_unit
       -breadcrumb (which captures the navigation path of the product on the website)
       -pdp_url (Product Detail Page URL)
       -product_description
       -image_urls

2- Parsing Results:
    Using the updated code, I have successfully parsed around 2,248 product records. These records contain the newly added fields, providing a richer dataset.

3- Data Storage:
    The parsed product data has been saved in two places:

    JSONL File: All 2,248 product records have been stored in a JSONL (JSON Lines) file, ensuring that each record is written in a structured, line-by-line format.
    MongoDB Database: The same data has also been saved in my MongoDB collection, ensuring easy querying and further analysis.
    Performance Improvements: While the code is running efficiently, Iâ€™m considering ways to further optimize its performance for faster parsing without altering the core functionality.
