Today, I successfully completed the development task for the website https://www.ewm.com/. The task included several key steps:

       1- Web Crawling and Data Parsing:

        The web crawling process was completed, and all relevant data was parsed from the site.
        I encountered a 403 Forbidden error, which was promptly resolved by adjusting the request headers and authentication mechanisms. This ensured smooth access to the website's content.

       2- Verification of Output:

        The data obtained from the crawling and parsing operations was carefully reviewed.
        After thorough validation, the output was confirmed to be accurate and in line with the project requirements.

       3- New Task Assigned:

        I have been assigned a new task to review three sets of provided data for potential errors.
        This task involves detailed checking of data integrity, accuracy, and formatting, and is currently in progress.
